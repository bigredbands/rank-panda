General TODOs (add some as you think of them):
-allow multiple rank selection/editing
-implement FTA (+ XML support)

-have confirmation box for deleting (full) move (we already have this for ranks!)
-when we try to close and then choose to save as, the window shouldn't close if we hit “cancel”
-preserve line type in gate turns

-playback with uploaded mp3 (or other music type?) file
-export to video(?)
-be able to delete whole moves (EXCEPT Move 0)
-have confirmation box for deleting (full) move or rank

- have fun
